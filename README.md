# Flutter Studies Repo
This repo portraits my flutter studies progress.

## Udemy course
Started an [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-flutter/?src=sac&kw=aprenda+flutter) by an indication of a good friend, it is a Udemy best-seller in portuguese version (which is my main language), but its original version is in english.
### SDK/Framework
* SDK will help us to generate native multi-platform code.
* Framework will give us widgets, buttons, functions, libs and everything else.

### Dart
Developed by Google it is O.O., strongly typed, looks like java, javascript and C#, focused on frontend (UI).

### Concepts
* **UI as a Code**: Build a widget tree.
* **Support platform differences**: can develop differences for each platform.
* **Single Code**: One code to rule them all.
* **Everything is widget**: It needs widget everywhere.
* **Base code:**
  * main.dart
  * list.dart
  * home.dart
* There is no native translation in runtime, the native translation happens in compilation time.
